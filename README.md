# Backend Repository: Safety Features with WebSockets and GMM Clustering

This repository contains the backend implementation for a safety-focused application with features like SOS, emergency calls, messages, nearby active user location tracking, frequent location updates using WebSockets, and safety route detection using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering. The project is built using **Node.js** and leverages modern libraries and tools for real-time communication and machine learning.

---

## Features

1. **SOS and Emergency Calls**: Users can trigger an SOS signal or initiate an emergency call to notify trusted contacts or authorities.
2. **Messages**: Real-time messaging between users and emergency contacts.
3. **Nearby Active User Location**: Track and share the location of nearby active users in real-time.
4. **Frequent Location Updates**: Use WebSockets to send frequent location updates from the client to the server.
5. **Safety Route Detection**: Use GMM clustering to detect safe routes based on historical location data.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building REST APIs.
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time, bidirectional communication using WebSockets.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user data, location history, and messages.
- **GMM Clustering**: Machine learning model for safety route detection.
- **JWT**: Authentication and authorization.
- **Redis**: Caching and pub/sub for real-time updates.

---

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
2. **MongoDB** (running locally or remotely)
3. **Redis** (optional, for caching and pub/sub)
4. **Python** (for GMM clustering, if using a Python script)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/backend-safety-features.git
   cd backend-safety-features
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/safety_app
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. (Optional) If using GMM clustering, ensure Python is installed and run the clustering script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/gmm_clustering.py
   ```

## API Endpoints

### 1. **SOS and Emergency Calls**
- **POST /api/sos**: Trigger an SOS signal.
- **POST /api/emergency-call**: Initiate an emergency call.

### 2. **Messages**
- **POST /api/messages/send**: Send a message to a user or group.
- **GET /api/messages/:userId**: Fetch messages for a user.

### 3. **Location Updates**
- **POST /api/location/update**: Update user location (WebSocket-based).
- **GET /api/location/nearby**: Fetch nearby active users.

### 4. **Safety Route Detection**
- **POST /api/route/detect**: Detect a safe route using GMM clustering.

---

## WebSocket Events

### Emitted by Client
- `locationUpdate`: Send frequent location updates to the server.
- `sosTriggered`: Notify the server when an SOS is triggered.

### Emitted by Server
- `nearbyUsers`: Send a list of nearby active users.
- `emergencyAlert`: Notify trusted contacts or authorities during an emergency.

## Safety Route Detection with GMM Clustering

The safety route detection feature uses Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering to analyze historical location data and identify safe routes. The clustering is implemented in Python and can be integrated with the Node.js backend via a script or API.

### Steps:
1. Collect historical location data.
2. Preprocess the data (e.g., normalize, remove outliers).
3. Apply GMM clustering to identify safe routes.
4. Store the results in the database for future use.
